- The submission requires 3 files to stored in proj1.tar.gz : poker.h, poker.c, and a Makefile.

- Please push all code for the 3 files on github. DO NOT push any .o or .exe or input files (usually .txt format) on github,     
  just the source code files. Look into how to set up .gitignore files if you're interested in reducing the work needed upon 
  every push.

- Please note that the FINAL submission of the project should still be on MyCourses and should include the tar.gz file.
